/**

 * @param router - we assign routes and endpoint functions for each route

 *
 * @param expressApp - an instance of the express app. By applying
 *                     expressApp.oauth.grant() method to an endpoint
 *                     the endpoint will return a bearer token
 *                     to the client if it provides calid credentials.
 *
 * @param authRoutesMethods - an object which contains the registration method. It
 *                           can be populated with other methods such as deleteUser()
 *                           if you decide to build out of this project's structure.
